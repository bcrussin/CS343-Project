            <h2>Meet Patrick</h2>
            <p>
              As a Charlottesville native, Patrick spent many years exploring
              the woods and creeks of central Virginia. That love of the
              outdoors naturally developed into an interest in plants and
              outdoor spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Patrick began mowing lawns at the age of eight. His first full
              time job was as a landscape laborer and, climbing the ladder, he
              eventually managed several crews for a local design-build firm.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating from
              <a href="https://www.wvu.edu/">West Virginia University</a> in
              1998, with a Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture,
              Patrick began working with clients to develop and implement
              landscape plans for their homes and offices.
            </p>
            <p>
              His grass roots work history led Patrick to open his own business
              in 2004 and he continues to practice as a Landscape Architect
              today. He brings decades of hands-on experience, and a
              multi-faceted knowledge of outdoor construction to every project.

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
              Church and family are the most important part of Patrick's life,
              and he continues his passion for the outdoors. In his free time,
              Patrick enjoys hiking, fishing, and camping. If a motorcycle can
              be combined with any of these activities, it's a bonus.

            <h3>Portfolio</h3>
            <p>
              Over the years, Patrick has worked with homeowners, builders, and
              property managers to develop plans for residential, commercial,
              and nonprofit properties. Combining his education in Landscape
              Architecture with his work experience, Patrick has been able to
              develop landscape designs and management plans for a diverse
              collection of clients and properties.
